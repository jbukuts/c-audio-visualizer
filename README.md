# C++ Audio Visualizer

Amplitude audio visualizer written in C++

## Starting locally

In order to build this project locally you'll need to have both OpenCV and CMake installed. I opted to build it from source from the [repo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

> Note: For OpenCV to be able to encode video you'll need to ensure when installing from source the `FFMPEG` option is set as true. 
If not you may need to install some additional packages.
